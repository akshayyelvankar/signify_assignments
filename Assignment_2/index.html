                <p class="userpost_text">A hobby gives us pleasure for we do it for the love of the work and not under
                    compulsion for any monetary or other benefit. Thus, it is more fulfilling and gives us satisfaction
                    and joy. My favourite hobby is reading. It is said ‘Reading is to the mind, what exercise is to the
                    body’. I truly believe that books are man’s best friend. Over the years, I feel books have become my
                    true friend. They cater to every mood and have the answers to all my questions.

                    With the popularity of computers and video games in recent times, the habit of reading has generally
                    taken a backseat. People are so occupied in watching movies, television and addicted to computer
                    games that they find little or no time for reading. However, those who have developed reading as a
                    hobby are aware of the countless advantages associated with it.My habit of reading started at an
                    early age, when my mother and my grandmother would tell stories at bedtime. They would tell me moral
                    stories and other fairy tales. I used to become so involved in these stories that I asked various
                    questions. I used to try to visualise the stories by adding my own elaborative version to it. As I
                    grew up, my eagerness and curiosity only increased, making me realise that there are many more towns
                    to be built and many more scenes that need a new shape of my imaginations.</p>
